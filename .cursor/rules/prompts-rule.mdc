copy each exact prompt I write to [prompts.md](mdc:prompts.md) using markdown format. Create the file if it does not exist. separate each prompt from the previous one using a markdown separator followed by a generated title for the new prompt. The title must start by the current date with the format "yyyy/mm/dd: hh:mm - " then the genearted title.

# Hello World Proof of Concept Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the steps required to implement a minimal viable proof of concept (POC) that demonstrates the core architectural concept of the Personal Database Assistant project. The POC will display a simple web page showing reservation dates for the FuerteVentura property for February 2025.

This implementation builds on existing infrastructure:
1. **Raspberry Pi 4** - Web application server (internet-facing) - to be set up in this POC
2. **Raspberry Pi 3B** - Database server (secured on internal network) - already configured and running

## Implementation Structure

Due to the complexity and detail required for each step, this implementation is divided into several sub-documents:

1. [Hardware Setup & Network Configuration](./01a_Hardware_Setup.md)
   - Setting up the Raspberry Pi 4
   - Configuring the network infrastructure
   - Establishing secure communication between devices

2. [Database Server Connection](./01b_Database_Server.md)
   - Connecting to the existing PostgreSQL database on Raspberry Pi 3B
   - Accessing the existing February 2025 reservation data
   - Creating an API client to fetch data

3. [Web Application Server Implementation](./01c_Web_Application.md)
   - Django project setup
   - API client for database communication
   - Simple React frontend
   - Docker containerization

4. [Public Access Configuration](./01d_Public_Access.md)
   - Domain name setup
   - SSL certificate configuration
   - Reverse proxy setup
   - Basic security measures

## POC Success Criteria

The proof of concept will be considered successful when:

1. The Raspberry Pi 4 hosts a web application accessible from the internet
2. The web application displays reservation dates for the FuerteVentura property for February 2025
3. The data is sourced from the existing PostgreSQL database on the Raspberry Pi 3B
4. Communication between the two devices follows the security architecture outlined in the project specification

## Data Sources

For this POC, we will use the existing database schema that includes:

- The Asset table with an entry for the FuerteVentura property
- The Reservation table with existing bookings for February 2025
- The RentalPlatform table with platform information

## Next Steps After POC

Upon successful implementation of this POC, the project will proceed with:

1. Enhancement of security measures between the devices
2. Implementation of the Data Privacy Vault
3. Development of more sophisticated frontend features
4. Implementation of additional API endpoints for other data needs

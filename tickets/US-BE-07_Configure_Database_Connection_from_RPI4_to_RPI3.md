## Description
As a backend developer, I want to establish a secure connection between the application server (RPI4) and the existing database server (RPI3), so that the application can retrieve health data from the existing database.

### Context
This ticket supports the goal of establishing secure database connectivity between the application components on Raspberry Pi 4 and the existing database on Raspberry Pi 3B.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Connection is established over local network
- Connection uses encrypted communication
- Connection parameters are stored securely
- Connection is resilient to temporary network issues
- Database credentials are stored as environment variables, not in code
- Connection doesn't interfere with existing database operations on RPI3
- Connection is properly documented with network diagrams

## Technical Details
- Setup secure connection credentials and parameters
- Implement connection pooling for efficiency
- Configure connection timeout and retry logic
- Document the existing database schema
- Ensure minimal privileges are used for the connection
- Implement logging for connection events

## Dependencies
- US-BE-42: Design API Bridge Architecture
- US-BE-49: Implement Network Security Between Raspberry Pi Devices

## Definition of Done
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Code is peer-reviewed
- Documentation is updated with connection details and network diagram
- Changes are committed to version control
- Unit tests are implemented and passing
- Connection security is verified
- No interference with existing database operations verified

## Metadata
- **Type**: Backend Development
- **Epic**: API Bridge and Database Connectivity
- **Priority**: M
- **Sprint**: 2

## Description
As a backend developer, I want to create a service to handle database queries, so that API endpoints can efficiently retrieve data from the existing database on RPI3.

### Context
This service will act as an intermediary between the application's API endpoints and the database connection to the existing database on Raspberry Pi 3B. It will provide a clean abstraction for executing queries and processing results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Service abstracts database operations from API endpoints
- Service implements connection pooling for efficiency
- Queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection
- Service handles connection timeouts and retries
- Service includes logging for query performance monitoring
- Queries respect the existing database schema on RPI3
- Service appropriately routes queries through the API Bridge

## Technical Details
- Implement query builder pattern for constructing database queries
- Create abstraction layer for common query operations
- Implement connection pool management
- Add comprehensive logging for query performance
- Create error handling and retry mechanisms
- Implement query sanitization and parameterization
- Document interaction with existing database schema

## Dependencies
- US-BE-07: Configure Database Connection from RPI4 to RPI3
- US-BE-09: Implement Symptom Data Models
- US-BE-43: Implement API Bridge Service

## Definition of Done
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Code is peer-reviewed
- Documentation is updated with query service details
- Changes are committed to version control
- Unit tests are implemented and passing
- Query service performance is verified
- Security best practices for database access are implemented

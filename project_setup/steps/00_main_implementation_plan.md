# Personal Database Assistant - Implementation Plan

This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step process for setting up the Personal Database Assistant project, first as a Proof of Concept (POC) on your local machine, and then transferring it to Raspberry Pi 4.

## Overview

The Personal Database Assistant is a secure, internet-accessible interface to an offline personal database. It uses a two-device architecture:
- **Database Server (Raspberry Pi 3B)**: Hosts PostgreSQL and maintains offline security
- **Web Application Server (Raspberry Pi 4)**: Internet-facing component with containerized services

For development efficiency, we'll first implement everything on your local machine using Docker containers, then transfer the working solution to the Raspberry Pis.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Local Development Environment Setup
1. [Development Environment Setup](./01_development_environment_setup.md)
   - Setting up Docker, Docker Compose, and necessary development tools
   - Creating project directory structure

2. [Container Infrastructure Setup](./02_container_infrastructure_setup.md)
   - Creating Docker Compose configuration
   - Setting up base container images for all services

### Phase 2: Core Application Development
3. [Backend API Development](./03_backend_api_development.md)
   - Creating Django REST Framework application
   - Setting up database models and API endpoints

4. [Frontend Development](./04_frontend_development.md)
   - Building React application with TypeScript
   - Implementing UI components and API integration

5. [Data Privacy Vault Implementation](./05_data_privacy_vault.md)
   - Setting up sensitive data storage and access controls
   - Implementing data tokenization and encryption

### Phase 3: Integrations and Advanced Features
6. [AI Integration](./06_ai_integration.md)
   - Implementing OpenAI API integration
   - Building chatbot functionality

7. [Email Processing Pipeline](./07_email_processing.md)
   - Gmail API integration
   - Email metadata indexing and processing

8. [Document Processing](./08_document_processing.md)
   - OCR capabilities
   - Document classification and data extraction

### Phase 4: Local to Raspberry Pi Migration
9. [Raspberry Pi Setup](./09_raspberry_pi_setup.md)
   - Setting up Raspberry Pi 3B and 4
   - Configuring network and firewall settings

10. [Deployment to Raspberry Pi](./10_raspberry_pi_deployment.md)
    - Transferring containers to Raspberry Pi 4
    - Database setup on Raspberry Pi 3B

11. [Network Configuration](./11_network_configuration.md)
    - Setting up secure communication between devices
    - Configuring internet access and SSL certificates

### Phase 5: Security and Optimization
12. [Security Hardening](./12_security_hardening.md)
    - Implementing additional security measures
    - Conducting security testing

13. [Performance Optimization](./13_performance_optimization.md)
    - Optimizing for Raspberry Pi hardware
    - Implementing caching and performance improvements

14. [Monitoring and Maintenance](./14_monitoring_maintenance.md)
    - Setting up container monitoring
    - Implementing backup and recovery procedures

## Key Considerations for Local-to-Pi Migration

1. **Architecture Consistency**: Use the same container structure locally as will be used on the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Platform-Specific Images**: Ensure Docker images support both your development platform and ARM architecture.
3. **Resource Constraints**: Be mindful of the Raspberry Pi's limited resources when developing.
4. **Network Simulation**: Simulate the two-device architecture locally using separate Docker networks.

## Next Steps

Begin with the [Development Environment Setup](./01_development_environment_setup.md) to start implementing your Personal Database Assistant.

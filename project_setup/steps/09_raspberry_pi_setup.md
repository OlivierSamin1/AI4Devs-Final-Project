# Raspberry Pi Setup

This document outlines the steps for setting up the Raspberry Pi hardware for the Personal Database Assistant project.

## Overview

We will configure two Raspberry Pi devices:
- **Raspberry Pi 3B**: The offline database server
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: The internet-facing application server

## Implementation Guide

This is a brief outline of the implementation guide. For a fully detailed version, please refer to the complete documentation [here](https://github.com/yourusername/personal-db-assistant/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Setup).

### Hardware Requirements

For **Raspberry Pi 3B** (Database Server):
- Raspberry Pi 3B or 3B+
- 32GB+ microSD card (high endurance preferred)
- Power supply (2.5A recommended)
- Ethernet cable

For **Raspberry Pi 4** (Application Server):
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB RAM recommended)
- 64GB+ microSD card (high endurance preferred)
- Power supply (3A USB-C)
- Ethernet cable
- Optional: Raspberry Pi 4 case with fan for cooling

### Key Configuration Considerations

* Proper power management for stability
* Overclocking considerations for performance
* Storage optimization techniques
* Backup strategies for SD cards
* Temperature management for reliable operation
* Boot security measures

## Next Steps

Once you've set up your Raspberry Pi hardware, proceed to [Raspberry Pi Deployment](./10_raspberry_pi_deployment.md) to deploy your Personal Database Assistant to the Raspberry Pi devices.

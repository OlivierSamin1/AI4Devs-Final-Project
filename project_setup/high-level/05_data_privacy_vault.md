# Data Privacy Vault Implementation

This document outlines the steps for implementing the Data Privacy Vault for securely storing sensitive personal information.

## Overview

The Data Privacy Vault provides:
- Tokenization of sensitive data
- Encryption at rest
- Controlled API access
- Audit logging of data access
- Purpose-based access controls

## Implementation Guide

This is a brief outline of the implementation guide. For a fully detailed version, please refer to the complete documentation [here](https://github.com/yourusername/personal-db-assistant/wiki/Data-Privacy-Vault-Implementation).

### Key Security Considerations

* Key management strategies
* Multi-layered encryption approach
* Token generation with sufficient entropy
* API authentication with HMAC verification
* Complete audit trails of all access attempts
* Strong input validation and sanitization

## Next Steps

Once you've implemented the Data Privacy Vault, proceed to [AI Integration](./06_ai_integration.md) to add AI-powered functionality to your Personal Database Assistant.

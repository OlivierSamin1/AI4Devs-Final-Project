# Document Processing

This document outlines the steps for implementing document processing capabilities for the Personal Database Assistant.

## Overview

The document processing module provides:
- OCR capabilities for scanning documents
- Intelligent data extraction from various document types
- Document classification system
- Validation workflow for extracted data
- Storage and retrieval of processed documents

## Implementation Guide

This is a brief outline of the implementation guide. For a fully detailed version, please refer to the complete documentation [here](https://github.com/yourusername/personal-db-assistant/wiki/Document-Processing).

### Key Implementation Considerations

* Efficient OCR processing for various document types
* Robust document classification algorithms
* Accurate data extraction from structured and semi-structured documents
* Validation rules for different document types
* Secure storage of sensitive documents
* Performance optimization for large documents

## Next Steps

Once you've implemented the document processing capabilities, proceed to [Raspberry Pi Setup](./09_raspberry_pi_setup.md) to prepare your Raspberry Pi hardware for deployment.
